# DESCRIPTION  :
For my final year project, we developed an innovative ***'Sensor-based Eye-controlled Automated Wheelchair'*** prototype aimed at enhancing mobility and independence for individuals with limited physical abilities especially for ***Paralyzed patients (Quadriplegia)***. 

# TECHNOLOGIES USED  :

1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
2. Raspberry Pi Camera
3. Deep Learning Algorithm (Convolutional Neural Network - CNN)
4. NodeMCU (ESP8266) for wireless communication
5. Motor driver for controlling wheelchair movement

# SKILLS ACQUIRED  :
- Deep Learning
- Raspberry Pi
- Embedded Software Programming (Python)
- Team Coordination

# PROJECT DETAILS  :

1. The Pi camera captures the user's eye movements, and the images were processed by a deep learning CNN model that I trained. The CNN accurately classified the eye movements into different commands, such as forward, backward, left, and right.
2. The control commands were sent wirelessly to the NodeMCU(ESP8266) using the HTTP protocol , ensuring seamless and reliable communication.
3. The NodeMCU received the commands and translated them into precise motor control signals, allowing for smooth and responsive navigation of the wheelchair prototype.
