# DESCRIPTION  :

- This is an ***'OTP based Wireless Locking System'***. Every time you unlock this smart lock, it can create a new password, further boosting your security.
- The electronic wireless lock system and the conventional key-based system are both significantly less secure than this gadget. In the event that your key is lost or stolen while you are still utilising the key-based system, you could face serious issues. A similar security flaw exists with the electronic wireless lock technology. Passwords are prone to forgetting, and hacking is a real possibility.
- I present a smart lock to you for your safety and security that is capable of eliminating all these security dangers and issues.

# COMPONENTS USED  :
1. Arduino UNO
2. Bluetooth Hc05
3. LED
4. Jumper Wires
5. Servo Motor
6. Lock
7. 5V Battery/Power Bank

# SOFTWARE USED  :
1. MIT App Inventor
2. Arduino IDE

# SKILLS ACQUIRED  :
- Embedded Software Programming
- Wireless communication (Bluetooth)
- Team Co-ordination

# PROJECT DETAILS  :
1.  First, connect the Arduino and components to a power supply (5V).
2.  Next, open the installed App, then turn on the Bluetooth of the phone. When you tap on the Bluetooth icon, you will get the list of Bluetooth connections for pairing.
3.  Now, tap on HC 05. On successful pairing, you will get a ‘connected’ message on the App.
4.  After that, tap on the key icon to send the device id to match.
5.  If the device id is matched, it will send an OTP to your app that you can see in the App text bar between Bluetooth and the lock icon.
6.  Now, you can tap on the lock icon to unlock your Smart Lock.
7.  If everything is ok then the servo moves the unlocking mechanism and the onboard LED of Arduino lights up indicating successful unlock.
