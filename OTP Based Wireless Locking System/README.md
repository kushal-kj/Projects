# DESCRIPTION  :

- This is an ***'OTP based Wireless Locking System'***. Every time you unlock this smart lock, it can create a new password, further boosting your security.
- The electronic wireless lock system and the conventional key-based system are both significantly less secure than this gadget. In the event that your key is lost or stolen while you are still utilising the key-based system, you could face serious issues. A similar security flaw exists with the electronic wireless lock technology. Passwords are prone to forgetting, and hacking is a real possibility.
- I present a smart lock to you for your safety and security that is capable of eliminating all these security dangers and issues.
